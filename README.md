# H1N1-Flu-Classification
Keywords: H1N1 Pandemic, Classification, Machine Learning

# Summary
This report presents an analysis of an H1N1 vaccination imbalanced dataset using various aspects of the
participantsâ€™ backgrounds information to predict whether participants have received H1N1 flu vaccines. The
machine learning classifiers employed include SVM, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, neural
network, and boosting. The study focuses on optimizing the tuning parameters of each model using K-fold
cross-validation to enhance the ROC-AUC and PR-AUC scores. The findings reveal that most classifiers
achieved an ROC-AUC score of approximately 0.89, with random forest, neural network, and boosting
demonstrating a higher PR-AUC of 0.76. After evaluating performance metrics, interpretability, and time
complexity, XGBoost, GBM, and random forest are deemed the most appropriate classifiers for this specific
dataset.
